Source Code for my 2023 GMTK GameJam Submission


CarGeneral.cs is for Input handling of the car and player.


PlayerScripts.cs is for handling Data of the player. Like score data. 


escapeMenu.cs is for handling inGame pause menu


settings.cs is for handling settings like screen resolution and fullscreen option.


square.cs is the most important and complicated(not really tbh) script of the project. It handles things like spawning new prefabs, handling collision for parking spot in the game etc.




You can use the source code for your own project.
